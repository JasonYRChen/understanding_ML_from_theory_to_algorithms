Version 1

This version can only accept fully seperable bipartite dataset. Every
datum has a coordinate in length of m and a corresponding signed number 
that is either +1 or -1, which is used to partition the dataset. Let 
datum be Xi, which is a m length vector, and its corresponding signed
number be Yi for which i = 1 ~ n and n is the total number of data. The 
linear equation used to partition the data has a form of W @ X + b = 0,
where W is a m length vector of linear coefficients, @ is a dot operator,
and b is a constant. We can then reform the equation to W' @ X' = 0 in
which W' is the original W with an additional coefficient b, and X' is
the X with an additional constant of 1. Here both W' and X' are in length
of m + 1.
Now, if the partition is done, condition Yi * (W' @ Xi') > 0 holds for
every datum, since we've assumed the data is fully seperable. Our work
is to iterate W' so that for every Xi and Yi satisfies the inequality.
For any (Xi, Yi) that the inequality not hold, we use W'' = W' + Yi * Xi
in new iteration.
